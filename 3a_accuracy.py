#################### TESTING & RESULTS FROM JUST ACCURACY, NAMES_OR_OBJECTS, NTH_PARTICIPANT

# CHECK PERCENT ACCURATE ON NAMES VS OBJECTS (AGGREGATE PARTICIPANTS)
# accuracy_byType = accuracy.groupby('names_or_objects')['accuracy'].agg(['count', 'sum'])
# ^^ looks good. 350 entries on names test (10 qs, 35 participants.) 490 entries on objects test (14 qs, 35 participants.)
# accuracy_byType['pct'] = accuracy_byType['sum']/accuracy_byType['count']
# ^^ names: 75% accurate
# ^^ objects: 70% accurate. That's great! 
# Takeaways: there's a correct number of rows. Difficulty is calibrated reasonably well.
# Takeaways: the two tests have different difficulty, aggregated across participants.
